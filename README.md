CRUD Node Js and MongoDB
CRUD and MongoDB are big words for a person who has never touched any server-side programming in their life. Letâ€™s quickly introduce what they are before we diving into the tutorial.
Express is a framework for building web applications on top of Node.js. It simplifies the server creation process that is already available in Node. In case you were wondering, Node allows you to use JavaScript as your server-side language.
MongoDB is a database. This is the place where you store information for your web websites (or applications).
CRUD is an acronym for Create, Read, Update and Delete. It is a set of operations we get servers to execute (POST, GET, PUT and DELETE respectively). This is what each operation does:
  Create (POST) - Make something
  Read (GET)_- Get something
  Update (PUT) - Change something
  Delete (DELETE)- Remove something
If we put CRUD Node js and MongoDB together into a single diagram, this is what it would look like:
